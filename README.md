# 👋 Hello, Data World!

Welcome to my first public data project!  
This repository is part of my learning journey as I transition from civil engineering into the world of data analytics and Python programming.

## 🧠 About This Project

This is a beginner-friendly project created to:
- Practice data manipulation and analysis using **Python** and **Pandas**
- Learn the basics of working with datasets
- Start building a public portfolio that reflects my progress

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- (Optional: Excel, CSV, or any public dataset)

## 🚀 Learning Goals

- Load and explore data using Pandas
- Clean, filter, and transform real-world datasets
- Create basic visualizations (later with Matplotlib or Seaborn)
- Write clean, well-documented code in a reproducible way

## 📁 Project Structure

```
hello-data-jexa/
├── data/                # Raw data files (e.g. .csv)
├── notebooks/           # Jupyter notebooks with analysis
├── README.md            # This file!
```

## ✨ Next Steps

This repository will grow as I complete mini-projects and exercises.  
I'll document each step, explain my logic, and improve over time – one dataset at a time.
